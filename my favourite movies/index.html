        <p>Most movie guys would scoff at Back to the Future being on this list, but just because it's not an arthouse movie doesn't mean that it shouldn't be on this list. <br> Back to the Future is super engaging, cool and an absolute classic. It has really likeable characters and it's just really good. It takes a unique take on time travel <br> and it's actually really funny, with Marty McFly's mum falling in love with him, in addition to great world building. The movie just does everything right and it's <br> also really rewatchable, I could watch it everyday for a year and be satisfied.</p>

        <br>
        <p>The original Star Wars was and still is a cultural icon. It has a slow but perfect pace, well written characters and created the Star Wars universe. <br> The use of practical effects is still impressive to this day and this movie changed the landscape of cinema. It was so big and without it, there wouldn't <br> be Marvel movies or other blockbusters. Star Wars has aged perfectly and it’s earned its spot on this list.</p>

        <p>Schindler's List is a film that no one _xHEv0l-w&pp=ygUUc3RhciB3YXJzIGl2IHRyYWlsZXI%3D" target="_blank">Schindler's List Trailer</a>

        <br>
        <p>Sequels hardly stand with their predecessors in quality, but the Godfather Part II is a notable exception. The film takes a darker look at the <br> character of Michael Corleone, as well as serving as a prequel, showing how the family business started when Vito Corleone moved from <br> Sicily to America. With great directing, characters and deep storytelling, there was only ever going to be one movie above it.</p>

  <hr>left unchanged. The holocaust was such a big tragedy that director Stephen Spielberg perfectly conveyed. <br> The acting was also brilliant, with Liam Neeson playing Oskar Schindler, getting nominated for an Oscar for his role. Renowned for its realistic <br> depiction of the holocaust, Schindler's List is a must see movie that earns its spot on this list.</p>

  <h2>1. The Godfather</h2>

            title="The Godfather Poster"
        <br>
        <p>TThe Godfather is the best movie ever made. From Francis Ford Coppola's masterful cinematography to the unique style of storytelling, <br> it surpasses every other film that I've ever seen. It shows how Michael Corleone, a well-respected World War 2 veteran, became a part of the <br>family business to save his dad's life. The film displays many themes through this and the well written characters and for that, it’s the best movie ever made.</p>
